This will result in compression of organs and will destroy the function of colon, small intestine, stomach, or other organs. Prognosis with treatment in many cases is optimistic,but the disease is lethal if untreated, with death by cachexia, bowel obstruction, or other types of complications This disease is most commonly caused by an appendiceal primary cancer (cancer of the appendix); mucinous tumors of the ovary have also been implicated, although in most cases ovarian involvement is ored to be a metastasis from an appendiceal or other gastrointestinal source. Disease is typically classified as low- or high-grade (with signet ring cells). When disease presents with low-grade histologic features the cancer rarely spreads through the lymphatic system or through the bloodstream The primary tumor appears to arise from the MUC2 expressing goblet cells and most commonly from these cells in the appendix. The K-Ras and p53 genes may be involved in the oncogenesis. It may be diagnosed with a range of conditions. While the majority of these cases are associated with appendiceal carcinomas,other conditions may also be found, including disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis (DPAM), peritoneal carcinomas, several mucinous tumors (mucinous adenocarcinoma, mucinous cystadenoma, and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma), as well as other disease states.Other primary sites that have been repoed include colon, rectum, stomach, gallbladder, bile ducts, small intestine, urinary bladder, lung, breast, fallopian tubes, and the pancreas Ref Davidson edition23rd pg826\n\nAnswer: B"}], "ground_truth": "B", "prompt": "Question: Pseudomyxoma peritonie is seen with -\n\nOptions:\nA) Thecoma ovary\nB) Mucin secreting ovarian carcinoma\nC) Carcinoid appendix\nD) Mesothelioma\n\nProvide your step-by-step analysis, then state your answer as 'Answer: X' where X is the option letter.", "source": "medmcqa"}

These tumors, like other soft tissue sarcomas, present as slow-growing, indolent masses (sometimes can be aggressive). Unlike typical sarcomas however, these tumors rarely metastasize.o Desmoids are diffusely infiltrative and tend to recur locally, even after complete resection.o Most desmoid tumors arise sporadically, but a small percentage (~5%) occurs in association with FAP syndromeo Desmoids are classified as either abdominal or extra-abdominal. Abdominal desmoids are categorized further as superficial or intra-abdominal tumors . The superficial disease, also known as Dupuytren's fibromatosis, is slow growing, is small in size, and rarely involves deeper structures.Most of the intra-abdominal lesions are seen in association with FAP. These lesions are associated with mutations in the APC gene that are found in patients who have FAP. These tumors usually are found in the mesentery, and their growth and compression of neighboring structures can lead to significant morbidity and sometimes even death in these patientso Sporadic abdominal wall desmoid tumors have been found to be associated with pregnancy. Oral contraceptive use has also been associated with the occurrence of these tumors. These associations, combined with the detection of estrogen receptors within the tumor, suggest a regulatory role for estrogen in this disease. Tissue injury, such as trauma and/or surgery, also has been implicated in tumor developmento The natural history of desmoid lesions is unpredictable. Although most are indolent and slow growing, some lesions are aggressive. There are some reports of spontaneous regression, but such occurrences are mainly in women and are associated with chemical or surgical menopause. Most lesions are indolent and have benign- appearing histology, but local growth and compression have caused significant morbidity. Involvement of abdominal vessels and organs often complicates management.o Patients with desmoid tumors present with a painless enlarging mass. Local symptoms may arise from compression of adjacent organs or neurovascular structureso MRI is done to define the extent of disease and its relationship with other structureso Incisional biopsy or a core needle biopsy is done to confirm the diagnosis.Management:# Surgery with wide negative margins is the best treatment. Unfortunately, even with complete resection, the local recurrence rate is as high as 40%. Surgery is also the tit of choice for recurrences.# For tumors where vital visceral organs and local infiltration often make achieving negative margins difficult, other therapeutic modalities have been suggested.o Antiproliferative agents and cytotoxic chemotherapy have been used to palliate these tumors with variable results. The two most widely used groups of noncytotoxic drugs are NSAIDs (such as sulindac and indomethacin) and antiestrogens (such as tamoxifen).o Chemotherapy has generally been reserved for unresectable, symptomatic, and clinically aggressive disease. Partial responses have been observed after treatment with doxorubicin, actinomycin C, dacarbazine, or carboplatin, although toxicity has been relatively high.o Radiotherapy-\"The role of radiation therapy in the management of these tumors, either as an adjunct to surgery or as primary treatment, continues to be defined.\" - Sabiston\n\nAnswer: B"}], "ground_truth": "B", "prompt": "Question: Desmoid tumor, treatment is -\n\nOptions:\nA) Local excision\nB) Wide excision\nC) Wide excision with radiotherapy\nD) Radiotherapy\n\nProvide your step-by-step analysis, then state your answer as 'Answer: X' where X is the option letter.", "source": "medmcqa"}

It is a manifestation of excessive proliferation of spindle cells that are believed to be of vascular origin, it is more a consequence of disordered cytokine regulation of cell growth than a true cancer. Generally speaking the tumor respects tissue planes and is rarely invasive. Disseminated K.S. is believed to be d/t occurrence of multiple neoplasm all over the body rather than to metastasis.Though K.S. is an opportunistic ds in HIV-infected individuals but unlike opportunistic infection, its occurrence is not strictly related to the level of depression of CD4+T cells counts. It may be seen at any stage of HIV inf. even in the presence of normal CD4+T cell count.Human Herpes virus-8 (HHV-8) is universally present in all forms of KS (in all the 4 types)In contrast to most malignancies, in which lymph node involvement implies metastatic spread and a poor prognosis, lymph node involvement may be seen very early in K.S. and is of no clinical significance.Management of KS associated with HIVIn the majority of cases, effective ARV therapy is quite helpful in achieving control. Spontaneous regressions have been reported in the setting of HAART.For patients in whom tumor persists or in whom control of HIV replication is not possible options exist.Treatment is indicated under two main circumstances.For a single lesion or a limited number of lesions causing significant discomfort or cosmetic problemslocalized radiation,intralesional vinblastine, orcryotherapyFor large number of lesions or visceral involvementSystemic therapies, either IFN- or chemotherapy is consideredInterferon- IFN provides an added advantage of having ARV activity; thus, it may be the appropriate first choice for single-agent systemic therapy for early patients with disseminated disease.Chemotherapy- Three of the chemotherapeutic agent that have been approved by the FDA for KS are:liposomal daunorubicin,liposomal doxorubicin, andpaclitaxelLiposomal daunorubicin is approved as first-line therapy for patients with advanced KS.The single most important determinant of response appears to be the CD4+ T cell count.Management of AIDS Associated Kaposi's SarcomaAntiretroviral therapySingle or limited number of lesionsLocalized radiationIntralesional vinblastineCryotherapyExtensive diseaseInitial therapyInterferon- (if CD4+ T cells >150/L)Liposomal daunorubicinSubsequent therapyLiposomal doxorubicinPaclitaxelCombination chemotherapy with low-dose doxorubicin, bleomycin, and vinblastine (ABV)Radiation treatment So the option (C) is not totally correct but option (D) is absolutely wrong.\n\nAnswer: D"}], "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "Question: All are true regarding kaposi sarcoma except one :\n\nOptions:\nA) Predominent in male\nB) Multicentric origin\nC) Chemotherapy is treatment of choice\nD) Occurs in AIDS pt only\n\nProvide your step-by-step analysis, then state your answer as 'Answer: X' where X is the option letter.", "source": "medmcqa"}

C: 0.5 to 3 microns Dust paicle within the range of 0.5-3 micron, is a health hazard producing, after a variable exposure, a lung disease known as pneumoconiosis Common Occupational Lung Diseases Asbestosis, caused by exposure to asbestos paicles. Often found among people who worked in shipyards, asbestos mines, and factories that refined or used asbestos to manufacture products. Black lung (Coalworker's pneumoconiosis) which affects coal workers Chronic Beryllium disease (CBD), which affects workers in a variety of metallurgical occupations Byssinosis (brown lung disease), often occurs in cotton and textile workers when bacteria released from cotton or other materials is inhaled and grows with the lungs. This is often associated with poor ventilation systems. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, this can affect people who work in office buildings whose air-conditioning systems are contaminated by ceain fungi and bacteria. Occupational asthma, can affect people who work with a variety of materials. This includes animals (dander), carbamates (urethanes), dyes, epoxy resins and enzymes used in detergent, leather goods, latex, and automotive paints Silicosis often developed by people who worked with clay, sand and stone dust including miners, stone cutters and sandblasters. How Diseases Develop Pneumoconiosis is the classification of diseases that develop as the result of occupational exposure to dust. Occupational lung diseases develop based on the size and type of paicles inhaled and where the inhaled paicle end up. Larger paicles are more likely to get stuck in the nose and larger airways but smaller paicles can reach the alveoli where they can potentially be absorbed into the bloodstream. When inhaled paicles come in contact with the wall of the airway they do not become airborne again. This is called deposition and can occur in one of four ways: - Sedimentation: When gravity causes paicles to settle, tends to occur in larger airways. - Ineial impaction: Often occurs in the nose and larger airways, it happens when an airway changes direction - Interception: This form of deposition occurs with fibrous dust paicles (including asbestos fibers) or any other irregular shaped paicles. Due to their shape they often avoid deposition by sedimentation or ineial impaction but are deposited in the walls of the bronchioles which are lined with epithelial cells. - Diffusion: Behavior of small aerosol paicles which encounter and are affected by molecules of air. During regular breathing (at rest) about 10% of compact paicles of 0.5 to 1 micron diameter are deposited in the alveoli with the vast majority being exhaled.\n\nAnswer: C"}], "ground_truth": "C", "prompt": "Question: Size range of dust, which is regarded as health hazard: September 2011\n\nOptions:\nA) 0.1 to 0.3 microns\nB) 0.3 to 0.5 microns\nC) 0.5 to 3 microns\nD) 3 to 5 microns\n\nProvide your step-by-step analysis, then state your answer as 'Answer: X' where X is the option letter.", "source": "medmcqa"}

Hyperplasia occurs when there is increased trophic stimulation (e.g., hormones, growth factors), increased functional demand, or persistent cell injury. Only labile and stable cells undergo hyperplasia; labile cells have stern cells that frequently divide, and stable cells have resting cells that are stimulated to enter the cell cycle. The presence of increased goblet cells in the mainstem bronchus of a smoker is an example of hyperplasia, because goblet cells are normally present in this area. However, their presence in the terminal bronchiole or gastric mucosa, where they are not normally found, is an example of metaplasia. Squamous epithelium in the bladder of a patient with Schistosoma haernatobium is an example of metaplasia, because the epithelium of a normal bladder is transitional. Irritation from the eggs of the schistosomes induces squamous metaplasia and the potential for dysplasia and squamous carcinoma. A distal esophagus with glandular epithelium intermixed with squamous epithelium is an example of Barrett esophagus. Chronic acid injury to the distal esophagus from gastroesophageal reflux stimulates the formation of mucoussecreting glandular epithelium, which is a type of glandular metaplasia and predisposes the patient to adenocarcinoma. Goblet and Paneth cells in the glands of the gastric mucosa is called intestinal metaplasia and is commonly seen in chronic atrophic gastritis of the body and fundus (type A) or pylorus and antrum (type B).

The primary detion is misalignment, with the normal eye fixating. If the paretic eye fixates, the ensuing secondary detion is typically larger than the primary detion.

These hair cells are similar to the hair cells found in the macula and cristae ampullaris of the vestibular apparatus. Bending of the hairs in one direction depolarizes the hair cells, and bending in the opposite direction hyperpolarizes them. This in turn excites the auditory nerve fibers synapsing with their bases. When the basilar fibers bend toward the scala vestibuli, the hair cells depolarize, and in the opposite direction they hyperpolarize, thereby generating an alternating hair cell receptor potential that, in turn, stimulates the cochlear nerve endings that synapse with the bases of the hair cells. It is believed that a rapidly acting neurotransmitter is released by the hair cells at these synapses during depolarization.

On the basis of their structure, cellular distribution and function, MHC gene products are classified into two major classes: * Class I MHC molecules- expressed on all nucleated cells and platelets. They are heterodimers consisting of a polymorphic a, or heavy, chain linked non-covalently to a smaller non polymorphic protein called b 2 -microglobulin. Class I MHC molecules display peptides that are derived from proteins, such as viral and tumor antigens, that are located in the cytoplasm and usually produced in the cell, and class I-associated peptides are recognized by CD8+ T lymphocytes. Since CD8+ T cells recognize peptides only if presented as a complex with class I MHC molecules, CD8+ T cells are said to be class I MHC-restricted. * Class II MHC molecules- encoded in a region called HLA-D, which has three subregions: HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DR. Class II molecule is a heterodimer consisting of a noncovalently associated a chain and b chain, both of which are polymorphic. Class II MHC molecules present antigens that are internalized into vesicles, and are typically derived from extracellular microbes and soluble proteins. The class II b 2 domain has a binding site for CD4, and therefore, the class II-peptide complex is recognized by CD4+ T cells.

These fibers are responsible .for the blood pressure rise and tachycardia produced by emotions such as sexual excitement and anger.The vasomotor centre is not silent during sleep The vasomotor centre neurons arc tonically active and discharge rhythmically.The vasomotor centre receives inputs from baroreceptors and also from chemoreceptors.The baroreceptors are stretch receptors in the walls of carotid sinus and aoic arch. The baroreceptors are stimulated by distention of the structures in which they are located, and so they discharge at an increased rate when the pressure in these structures rises. Increased baroreceptor discharge inhibits the tonic discharge of sympathetic nerves and excites the vagal innervation of the hea. These neural changes produce vasodilation, venodilation, a drop in blood pressure. bradycardia, and a decrease in cardiac output.Chemoreceptors are located in carotid and aoic bodies. These receptors are primarily activated by a reduction in paial pressure of oxygen (Pa02), but they also respond to an increase in the paial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and pH. Chemoreceptors exe their main effects on respiration; however, their activation also leads to vasoconstriction. Hea rate changes are variable and depend on various factors, including changes in respiration.Factors Affecting the Vasomotor centre (RVLM)Direct stimulationCO2HypoxiaExcitatory inputsCoex hypothalamusMesencephalic periaqueductal grayBrain stein reticular formationPain pathwaysSomatic afferents (somatosympathetic reflex)Carotid and aoic chemoreceptorsInhibitory inputsCoex hypothalamusCaudal ventrolateral medullaCaudal medullary raphe nucleiLung inflation afferentsCarotid, aoic, and cardiopulmonary baroreceptorsThus we see that the cardiovascular system is under neural influences of medulla, which in turn receive feedback from sensory receptors in the vasculature (eg, baroreceptors). An increase in neural output from the brain stem to sympathetic nerves leads to a decrease in blood vessel diameter (aeriolar constriction) and increases in stroke volume and hea rate, which contribute to a rise in blood pressure. This in turn causes an increase in baroreceptor activity, which signals the vasomotor centre to reduce the neural output to sympathetic nerves.Also know:The neurons of vasomotor centre secrete excitatory transmitter- glutamate (and not epinephrine)Inflation of the lungs causes vasodilation and a decrease in blood pressure. This response is mediated vagal afferents from the lungs that inhibit vasomotor discharge.In general, stimuli that increase the hea rate also increase blood pressure, whereas those that decrease the hea rate lower blood pressure. However, there are exceptions, such as the production of hypotension and tachycardia by stimulation of atrial stretch receptors and the production of hypeension and bradycardia by increased intracranial pressure (Cushing reflex).Cushing reflex: Increase in intracranial pressure compromises the blood supply to the vasomotor neurons, and the resulting local hypoxia and hypercapnia increase discharge from the vasomotor centre. This results in rise in systemic aerial pressure (Cushing reflex) which tends to restore the blood flow to the medulla. Over a considerable range, the blood pressure rise is propoional to the increase in intracranial pressure. The rise in blood pressure causes a reflex decrease in hea rate the aerial baroreceptors. This is why bradycardia rather than tachycardia is characteristically seen in patients with increased intracranial pressure.\n\nAnswer: A"}], "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "Question: Vasomotor centre of medulla is associated with?\n\nOptions:\nA) Acts with the cardiovagal centre to maintain B.P.\nB) Independent of coicohypothalamic inputs\nC) Influenced by baroreceptors not chemoreceptors\nD) Essetially silent in sleep\n\nProvide your step-by-step analysis, then state your answer as 'Answer: X' where X is the option letter.", "source": "medmcqa"}

Bushberg 2/e p3.56 writes? \"What do CT numbers correspond to physically in the patient? CT images are produced with a highly filtered, high-kV x-ray beam, with an average energy of about 75 keV. At this energy in muscle tissue, about 91% of x-ray interactions are Comptom scatter. For .fat and hone, Compton scattering interactions are 94% and 74%, respectively. Therefore, CT numbers and CT images derive their contrast mainly .from the physical propeies of tissue that influence Compton scatter. Density (g/cubic cm) is a very impoant discriminating propey of tissue, and the linear attenuation coefficient (p) tracks linearly with density. Other than physical density, the Compton scatter cross section depends on the electron density in tissue: Electron density = NZ/A where N is Avogadro's number (a constant) Z is the atomic number, A is the atomic mass The main constituents of soft tissue are hydrogen (Z = 1, A = 1), carbon (Z = 6, A = 12), nitrogen (Z = 7, A = 14), and oxygen (Z = 8, A = 16). Carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen all have the WA ratio of 0.5, so their electron densities are the same. Because the Z/A ratio .for hydrogen is 1.0, the relative abundance of hydrogen in a tissue has some influence on CT number. Hydrogenous tissue such as fat is well visualized on CT Neveheless, density (g/cubic cm) plays the dominant role in forming contrast in medical CT.\" \"The difference in electron density of tissues depends upon physical density. Therefore, the soft tissue contrast achieved in an image is primarily determined by the relative physical densities of the structures, not by the relative differences in atomic numbers.\"- Neuroimaging By Robe A. Zimmerman, Wendell A. Gibby, Raymond F. Carmody P5 CT is a tomographic imaging technique that generates cross-sectional images in the axial plane. The basic concept of x-ray CT is simple. By looking at an object from multiple directions a three dimensional representation of that object can be formed. A thin beam of x-rays is passed through the body from multiple different projections. When an x-ray beam passes through the body, there is a logarithmic attenuation of its intensity over distance. A measurement of the intensity of the exiting beam is known as the linear attenuation coefficient when the attenuator thickness is 1 cm. The linear attenuation coefficient is related to the absorption of a given material both photoelectric interaction and Comptom scattering interactions. This, of course, depends upon the energy of the x-ray beam and the type of material being irradiated. CT images are maps of the relative linear attenuation coefficient of tissues. The relative attenuation coefficient is normally expressed in Hounsfield units (HU), also known as CT numbers (Named in honor of the inventor of CT, Geoffrey Hounsfield). The HU of material Xis HU = 1000 X (14-14)/1.1.,,., where x, is the attenuation coefficient of the material X, and ix,. is the attenuation coefficient of water. By definition, the HU value for water is always zero.

Often seen in response to chronic irritation. Makes the cells able to withstand stress. Metaplasia is thought to arise by reprogramming of stem cells to differentiate along a new pathway. May result in reduced function or increased propensity for malignant transformation Two types - squamous metaplasia & columnar metaplasia. Squamous metaplasia: The normal columnar epithelial cells are focally or widely replaced by squamous epithelial cells. Eg: Chronic smokers - to survive the noxious chemicals in cigarette smoke Squamous metaplasia - columnar epithelial changes to squamous type. Eg: In chronic gastric reflux, the normal stratified squamous epithelium of lower oesophagus undergoes metaplastic transformation to gastric or intestinal type columnar epithelium. Metaplasia may also occur in mesenchymal cells but in these situations, it is generally a reaction to some pathologic alteration not an adaptive response to stress. Epithelial metaplasia is exemplified by the squamous change that occurs in the respiratory epithelium of habitual cigarette smokers (Fig. 1-5). The normal ciliated columnar epithelial cells of the trachea and bronchi are focally or widely replaced by stratified squamous epithelial cells. The rugged stratified squamous epithelium may be able to survive the noxious chemicals in cigarette smoke that the more fragile specialized epithelium would not tolerate. Although the metaplastic squamous epithelium has survival advantages, impoant protective mechanisms are lost, such as mucus secretion and ciliary clearance of paiculate matter. Epithelial metaplasia is therefore a double-edged sword. Moreover, the influences that induce metaplastic change, if persistent may predispose to malignant transformation of the epithelium In fact, squamous metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium often coexists with lung cancers composed of malignant squamous cells. It is thought that cigarette smoking initially causes squamous metaplasia, and cancers arise later in some of these altered foci.
