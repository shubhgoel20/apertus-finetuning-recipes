ADP is released by damaged erythrocytes and helps VWF to adhere to the exposed collagen. It is not, however, the binding factor that connects the VWF to the platelets. Factor VIII does not paicipate directly in the platelet poion of blood clot formation. Thromboxane A2 promotes subendothelial exposure after vascular injury and induces platelet aggregation. Also Know: Von Willebrand Disease is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. VWF serves two roles: (1) as the major adhesion molecule that tethers the platelet to the exposed subendothelium; and (2) as the binding protein for FVIII, resulting in significant prolongation of the FVIII half-life in circulation. The most common type of VWD is type 1 disease, with a parallel decrease in VWF protein, VWF function, and FVIII levels, accounting for at least 80% of cases. Patients have predominantly mucosal bleeding symptoms, although postoperative bleeding can also be seen. Menorrhagia is a common manifestation of VWD. The mainstay of treatment for type 1 VWD is 1-deamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP, or desmopressin), which results in release of VWF and FVIII from endothelial stores. Ref: Konkle B. (2012).

The only apoprotein present in LDL is apo B100 (Fig. 12.12). Most of the LDL paicles are derived from VLDL, but a small pa is directly released from liver. The half-life of LDL in blood is about 2 days. Metabolism of LDL and LDL Receptors LDL is taken up by peripheral tissues by receptor mediated endocytosis (see Fig. 12.13). LDL receptors are present on all cells but most abundant in hepatic cells. LDL receptors are located in specialised regions called clathrin-coated pitsBinding of LDL to the receptor is by apo-B-100 and uptake of cholesterol from LDL is a highly regulated process. When the apo-B-100 binds to the apo-B-100 receptor, the receptor-LDL complex is internalised by endocytosis. The endosome vesicle thus formed fuses with lysosomes.The receptor is recycled and returns to the cell surface. The LDL paicle, along with apoproteins and cholesterol ester are hydrolysed by lysosomal hydrolases, forming amino acids and free cholesterol. The free receptors can now return to the membrane surface to bind fuher LDL molecules (Fig. 12.13).Approximately 70% of LDL is degraded in the liver, and the rest in extra-hepatic tissues. For their work on LDL receptors, Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein were awarded Nobel prize in 1985. Function of LDL About 75% of the plasma cholesterol is incorporated into the LDL paicles. LDL transpos cholesterol from liver to the peripheral tissues. The cholesterol thus liberated in the cell has three major fates:It is used for the synthesis of other steroids like steroid hormones.Cholesterol may be incorporated into the membranes.Cholesterol may be esterified to a MUFA by acyl cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) for storage. The cellular content of cholesterol regulates fuher endogenous synthesis of cholesterol by regulating HMG CoA reductase. LDL and Clinical Applications LDL concentration in blood has positive correlation with incidence of cardiovascular diseases. A fraction of cholesterol is taken up by macrophages, this is not a regulated pathway. Increased levels of LDL or modification of LDL by glycation (as seen in diabetes mellitus) or oxidation increases the fraction of cholesterol taken up by macrophages. LDL infiltrates through aerial walls and is taken up by macrophages or scavenger cells. This is the staing event of atherosclerosis leading to myocardial infarction (see coronary aery diseases in Chapter 25). When these cells become engorged with cholesterol, foam cells are formed, that get deposited in the subendothelial space triggering formation of atheromatous plaque (see Fig. 25.3). Procoagulant changes are induced in the endothelium resulting in increased chances of thrombosis and coronary aery disease (Fig. 25.4). Since LDL-cholesterol is thus deposited in tissues, the LDL (low-density lipoprotein) variety is called \"bad cholesterol\" and LDL as \"Lethally Dangerous Lipoprotein\" in common parlanceRef: DM Vasudevan - Textbook of Biochemistry, 6th edition, page no: 153-154\n\nAnswer: B"}]}

Estrogen + Progesterone When H is to be given for a period more than 2-3 months, in woman with intact uterus progesterone should be given along with estrogen as progesterone is protective against Endometrial cancer. In Perimenopausal females : low dose OCP should be given. In Postmenopausal females : OCP's Should not be used, as the amount of estrogen is higher in them than required. In such cases oestrogen should be supplemented by progesterone for last 10-12 days of treatment. Most treatment regimes are on a cyclical 3 weeks out of 4 weeks. Progesterones used in H : Medroxy progesterone acetatedeg * Dydrogesteronedeg Norethisteronedeg * Desogestereldeg Micronized progesteronedeg Disadvantages of progesterones : Weight gain * Breast tenderness Bloated feeling * Depression Note : Progesterone should not be added in hysterectomised patients because of patients intolerance to them and for the fear of their adverse effects on lipid profile and the breast. 3. Tibolone : Is a synthetic derivative of 19 noestosteronedeg. It is metabolized into isomers with three major metabolic (oestrogenic, progestogenic and androgenic) effects. At a standard dose of 2.5 mg : Tibolone has beneficial effects on Bone Vasomotor symptoms i.e. Genital tract i.e. Libido Mood prevents osteoporosis hot flushes vaginal atrophy increase libido Total HDL, LDL are not altered Triglycerides are decreased Endometrium atrophy occurs Inhibits breast cell proliferation. Major advantages : Low incidence of vaginal bleedingdeg Can be used in women with leiomyomas and endometriosis in whom conventional H may cause aggravation of symptoms.deg estrogen Receptor Modulator - (SERM) Drug used : Raloxifene It prevents osteoporosis by increasing Bone mineral density (is useful for patients who are reluctant to use H or have H/O endometriosis or high risk of Breast cancer) It also has ourable effect on lipoprotein A, LDL, homocysteine and fibrinogen It has no effect on atherosclerosisdeg, HDLdeg levels and may even increase hot flushes and Leg cramps. deg Side effects : Hot flushes, Crampsdeg, Venous thrombosisdeg and Retinopathydeg. Contraindication : * Venous Thrombosis (should not be given with estrogen) Hepatic dysfunction It should be stopped 72 hours before Surgery. Androgens (Testosterone) : The only indication for the use of androgens in H is loss of libido. Recent Advances : Phytoestrogens These are substances found in plants like Soya and are strongly oestrogenic but-non steroidal thereby reducing the potential risk of breast cancer, liver disease and other side effects of estrogen. Their daily intake reduces hot flushes by 45% within 12 weeks. They improve plasma lipid profile and therefore inhibit the development of coronary atherosclerosis. Estrillshould no be used in women with any of the following conditions : 1. Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding. 2. Known, suspected, or history of breast cancer. 3. Known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia. 4. Active deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or history of these conditions. 5. Active or recent (e.g., within the past year) aerial thromboembolic disease (e.g., stroke or myocardial infarction). 6. Liver dysfunction or disease. 7. Known hypersensitivity to the ingredients of the estrogen preparation. 8. Known or suspected pregnancy. There is no indication for estrogen in pregnancy. There appears to be little or no increased risk of bih defects in children born to women who have used estrogens and progestins from oral contraceptives inadveently during early pregnancy Estrogen should be used with caution In women with the following conditions : 1. Dementia 2. Gallblader disease 3. Hyperiglyceridemia 4. Prior cholestatic jaundice 5. Hypothyroidism 6. Fluid retention plus cardiac or renal dysfunction 7. Severe hypocalcemia 8. Prior endometriosis 9. Hepatic hemangiomas Extra Edge Warnings and Precautions with Estrogen administration :\n\nAnswer: C"}]}

The duration of the treatment depending on the clinical indication is 1 week or longer. Tranexamic acid is given at doses of 25 mg/kg three to four times a day. EACA treatment requires a loading dose of 200 mg/kg (maximum of 10 g) followed by 100 mg/Kg per dose (maximum 30 g/d) every 6h.\nGeneral considerations regarding the treatment of bleeds in hemophilia include the following: (1) Treatment should begin as soon as possible because symptoms often precede objective evidence of bleeding; because of the superior efficacy of early therapeutic intervention, classic symptoms of bleeding into the joint in a\u00a0reliable patient, headaches, or automobile or other accidents require prompt replacement and further laboratory\u00a0investigation, (2) Drugs that hamper platelet function, such as aspirin or aspirin containing drugs, should be avoided; to control pain, drugs such as ibuprofen or propoxyphene are preferred. FVIII and FIX are dosed in units. One unit is defined as the amount of FVIII (100 ng/mL) or FIX (5 \u03bcg/mL) in 1 mL of normal plasma. One unit of FVIII per kilogram of body weight increases the plasma level by 2%. One can calculate the dose needed to increase FVIII levels to 100%\u00a0in a 70-kg severe hemophilia patient (<1%) using the simple formula below.\u00a0Thus, 3500 units of FVIII will raise the circulating level to 100%.\nFVIII dose (IU) = Target FVIII levels \u2013 FVIII baseline levels x Body weight (kg) x 0.5 unit/kg.\nThe doses for FIX replacement are different from those for FVIII, because FIX recover after infusion is usually only 50% of the predicted value. Therefore, the formula for FIX replacement is as follows:\nFIX dose (IU) = Target FIX levels \u2013 FIX baseline levels x Body weight (Kg) x 1 unit/Kg.\nThe FVIII half-life of 8-12 h requires injections twice a day to maintain therapeutic levels, whereas the FIX half-life is longer, 24 h, so that once-a-day injection is sufficient. In specific situations such as after surgery, continuous infusion of factor may be desirable because of its safety in achieving sustained factor levels at a lower total cost.\u00a0Cryoprecipitate is enriched with FVIII protein (each bag contains 80 IU of FVIII) and was commonly used for the treatment of hemophilia A decades ago; it is still in use in some developing countries, but because of the risk of bloodborne diseases, this product should be avoided in hemophilia patients when factor concentrates are available.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nReference:\u00a0 Harrison\u2019s Principles of Internal Medicine 20th ed page no 832\n\nAnswer: D"}]}

Comparatively early development of complicated cataract and secondary glaucoma (usually open angle type). Glaucoma has been repoed in 10-59% of cases. Treatment Fuch's heterchromic uveitis responds variable to steroids and cycloplegics. The complications of long term use of these drugs may at times outweigh their potential benefits. Therefore, treatment with topical steroids is given to iritis which is sufficiently active to require the treatment, otherwise the patient is routinely followed without giving any treatment. Cataract responds well to mostforms of intraocular surgeries, including the standard IOL implantation. Hyphernia may occur because of rubeosis iridis (neovascularization of iris).

Recall that the afferent limb of the pupillary light reflex is the optic nerve (CN II); the efferent limb is the oculomotor nerve (CN III; parasympathetic fibers). When light is shined into her right eye, because her right optic nerve is not functioning properly, the light signal is not transmitted to the CNS, resulting in no pupillary response. As light is shined into her left eye, the left optic nerve transmits the signal to the CNS, which then sends an outbound signal through both the right and left oculomotor nerves to cause pupillary constriction in both eyes. The oculomotor nerve innervates all extraocular muscles except the lateral rectus (innervated by the abducens nerve), and the superior oblique (innervated by the trochlear nerve. The oculomotor nerve also mediates pupillary constriction (parasympathetic fibers), eyelid opening (levator palpebrae), and innervates the ciliary muscle (allowing accommodation).

It is diagnosed at an average age of 4.5 plus or minus 3.5 years, and it is twice as common in females. The clinical course of IPH is exceedingly variable, and most of the patients continue to have episodes of pulmonary haemorrhage despite therapy. Death may occur suddenly from acute pulmonary haemorrhage or after progressive pulmonary insufficiency resulting in chronic respiratory failure. There are several methods available for diagnosing and monitoring hemosiderosis including: Serum ferritin Liver biopsy MRI Serum ferritin is a low cost, readily available, and minimally invasive method for assessing body iron stores. However, the major problem with using it as an indicator of hemosiderosis is that it can be elevated in a range of other medical conditions unrelated to iron levels including infection, inflammation, fever, liver disease, renal disease and cancer. While liver biopsies provide a direct measure of liver iron concentration, the small sample size relative to the size of the liver can lead to sampling errors given the heterogeneity of iron concentration within the liver. Fuhermore, the invasive nature of liver biopsy and the associated risks of complications (which can range from pain, haemorrhage, gallbladder perforation and other morbidities through to death in approx 1 in 10,000 cases) prevent it being used as a regular monitoring tool. MRI is emerging as an alternative method for measuring liver iron loading because it is non-invasive, safer and generally cheaper to perform than liver biopsy; does not suffer from problems with sampling variability; and can be used more frequently than performing liver biopsies.

Acute reaction (acute nonspecific lymphadenitis) can result in focal or generalized lymphadenopathy. Focal lymph node enlargement is usually the result of bacterial infection. Sections from involved lymph nodes reveal infiltration by neutrophils. In contrast, generalized acute lymphadenopathy is usually the result of viral infections and usually produces a proliferation of reactive T lymphocytes called T immunoblasts. These reactive T cells tend to have prominent nucleoli and can be easily mistaken for malignant lymphocytes or malignant Hodgkin cells. Reactive processes involving lymph nodes typically involve different and specific poions of the lymph nodes depending upon the type of cell that is reacting. For example, reactive B lymphocytes typically result in hyperplasia of the lymphoid follicles and germinal centers (follicular hyperplasia). Examples of diseases that are associated with follicular hyperplasia include chronic inflammation caused by organisms, rheumatoid ahritis, and AIDS. Lymph nodes from patients with AIDS undergo characteristic changes that begin with follicular hyperplasia with loss of mantle zones, intrafollicular hemorrhage (\"follicle lysis\"), and monocytoid B cell proliferation. Subsequently there is depletion of lymphocytes (CD4+ lymphocytes) in both the follicles and the interfollicular areas. In contrast to reactive B cell processes, reactive T lymphocytes typically result in hyperplasia involving the T cell areas of the lymph node, namely the interfollicular regions and the paracoex. Examples of clinical situations associated with a T lymphocyte response include viral infections, vaccinations, use of some drugs (paicularly Dilantin), and systemic lupus erythematosus. The sinusoidal pattern of reaction involves expansion of the sinuses by benign macrophages, as seen in reactive proliferations of the mononuclearphagocytic system.

C: Diabetes Insipidus Many possible conditions and lifestyle factors can lead to hyponatremia, including: Syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) - In this condition, high levels of the anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) are produced, causing the body to retain water instead of excreting it in urine. Cirrhosis - Liver disease can cause fluids to accumulate in the body. Kidney problems - Kidney failure and other kidney diseases can render the body unable to efficiently remove excess fluids from the body. Congestive hea failure - This condition causes the abdomen and lower extremities to retain fluids. Diuretics, especially thiazide diuretics- Diuretics work by making the body excrete more sodium in urine. Consuming excessive water during exercise (exeional hyponatremia or exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH)). Because sodium is lost through sweat, drinking too much water during endurance activities, such as marathons and triathlons, can dilute sodium content in blood. Hormonal changes due to adrenal gland insufficiency (Addison's disease). Adrenal glands produce hormones that help maintain the body's balance of sodium, potassium and water. Hormonal changes due to an under active thyroid (hypothyroidism). Primary polydipsia- In this condition, thirst increases significantly, causing a person to drink excessive amounts of fluid. Some medications, paicularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and some pain medications, cause a person to urinate or perspire more than normal. The recreational drug MDMA- This amphetamine causes a ripple effect on the body's ADH and water levels that-- especially in combination with heavy drinking--increases the risk of severe and even fatal cases of hyponatremia. Chronic, severe vomiting or diarrhea- This causes the body to lose fluids and electrolytes, including sodium. Dehydration- In dehydration, the body loses fluids and electrolytes. Diet- A low-sodium, high-water diet can disturb the proper balance between sodium and fluids in the blood\n\nAnswer: C"}]}

After hydroxylation of lysine and proline residues of procollegen three procollegen chains align in phase to form triple helix. After that oxidation of lysine & hydroxylysine by lysyl oxidase, and proline & hydroxyproline by prolyl oxidase, take place - this results in cross-linking between the chains of adjacent molecules, thus stabilizing the array that is characteristic of collegen.

Ghai - \"Operative correction of VUR is indicated inpts. with - persistent severe (grade IV or V) refluxThis statement does not mean that any pt. with grade IV & V reflux will be given surgical management and rest medical management. Treatment is not so clear-cut.The choice b/w medical or surgical modality is based on certain principles (go through the following text to understand it).The below given explanation is a bit lengthy. Bear with me for giving such a long text, as it is one of the most important but less read topic (UG books do not give sufficient information on its treatment).This explanation will help you to tackle any future question on t/t of VUR with different patient profile (as t/t changes with grades as well as age of the patient)Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR)is the retrograde flow of urine from the bladder to the ureter and the renal pelvisGrading of VUR : is based on the appearance of the urinary tract on Micturating Cystourethrogram (MCU).Grade 1reflux into a non-dilated ureterGrade IIreflux into the upper collecting system without dilatation.Grade IIIreflux into dilated ureter and /or blunting of calyceal fornicesGrade IVreflux into a grossly dilated ureterGrade VGross dilatation of the ureter, renal pelvis & calyces : calyces show loss of papillary impression. Complications of VURReflux predisposes to renal infection (pyelonephritis) by facilitating the transport of bacteria from the bladder to the upper urinary tract.The inflammatory reaction caused by a pyelonephritic infection may result in renal injury or scarring.Extensive renal scarring impair renal function and may result in renin mediated hypertension, reflux nephropathy, renal insufficiency, end stage renal disease, reduced somatic growth and morbidity during pregnancy.* TreatmentThe goals of t/t are to prevent pyelonephritis, renal injury, and other complication of reflux.Treatment modality is either medical or surgical.Medical therapyis based on the principle that reflux often resolves over time and the antibiotics maintain urine sterility and prevent infection and complication while awaiting spontaneous resolution.Surgical therapy :the basis for surgical therapy is that in selected children, ongoing reflux has caused or has significant potential for causing renal injury.The decision to do medical or surgical t/t is based on certain principles and parental, patient preferences.Below is given a chart listing the treatment recommendation for VUR.Before going through the chart lets see the basic principles on which this chart is based -With bladder growth and maturation, there is tendency for reflux to resolve or improve over time.Lower grades of reflux are much more likely to resolve than are higher grades.For grades I & II reflux, the likelihood of resolution is similar irrespective of age at diagnosis and whether if it unilateral or bilateral.For grade III & IV a younger age at diagnosis and unilateral reflux generally are associated with a higher rate of spontaneous resolution.Grade V reflux rarely resolves.The mean age for reflux resolution is 6 - 7 yrs.Reflux is unlikely to cause any renal injury in the absence of infection.Treatment Recommendation for VUR diagnosed following a UTI.GradeAge (yrs)ScarringInitial t/tFollow-upI-iiAny-Antibiotic prophylaxis-III - IV0-5-Antibiotic prophylaxisSurgeryIII - IV6- 10-U/L: Antibiotic prophylaxisSurgeryIII - IV6 - 10-B/L: Surgery V<1-Antibiotic prophylaxisSurgeryV1 - 5NoU/L: Antibiotic prophylaxisSurgeryV1 - 5NoB/L: Surgery V1 - 5YesSurgery V6- 10-Surgery * ThusMedical Management is the initial t/t in almost all children except for -Grade III & IV (Bilateral)Grade V (Mostly)Medical management (antibiotic prophylaxis) is continued till the reflux resolves.Pt. is shifted from medical to surgical management, in children withbreakthrough UTI (Recurrent UTI despite prophylaxis)Development of new renal scarsFailure of reflux to resolve.Thus in this question we will begin with medical management ie cotrimoxazole. This pt is having recurrent UTI. This will not alter our t/t. If the pt. had recurrent UTI despite prophylaxis, we would have done a surgical management.If you have a close look at the statement of O.P. Ghai, you will note that he is not stating that grades IV & V will be t/t surgically. It is persistent grades IV & V that are t/t surgically (persistent means VUR that are not resolving over time).\n\nAnswer: A"}]}

Over a sho period, this has become the main treatment of variceal haemorrhage that has not responded to drug treatment and endoscopic therapy. The shunts are inseed under local anaesthetic, analgesia and sedation, using fluoroscopic guidance and ultrasonography. Via the internal jugular vein and SVC, a guidewire is inseed into a hepatic vein and through the hepatic parenchyma into a branch of the poal vein. The track through the parenchyma is then dilated with a balloon catheter to allow inseion of a metallic stent, which is expanded once a satisfactory position is achieved to form a channel between systemic and poal venous systems. A satisfactory drop in poal venous pressure is usually associated with good control of the variceal haemorrhage. The main early complication of this technique is perforation of the liver capsule, which can be associated with fatal intraperitoneal haemorrhage. TIPSS occlusion may result in fuher variceal haemorrhage and occurs more commonly in patients with well-compensated liver disease and good synthetic function. Post-shunt encephalopathy is a confusional state caused by the poal blood bypassing the detoxification of the liver. It occurs in about 40% of patients, a similar incidence to that found after surgical shunts. If severe, the lumen of the TIPSS can be reduced by inseion of a smaller stent. T he main contraindication to TIPSS is poal vein occlusion. The main long-term complication of TIPSS is stenosis of the shunt, which is common (approximately 50% at 1 year) and may present as fuher variceal haemorrhage.

Lymphatic obstruction occurs as a result of mechanical blockage of lymphatics by tumor, inflammatory processes, or ceain parasitic infections. Cirrhosis does not lead to lymphatic obstruction. Reduced central venous pressure does not cause edema. Conversely, increased central venous pressure, which may arise with congestive hea failure, thrombosis, or cirrhosis can lead to increased hydrostatic pressure and edema. Sodium retention is an impoant cause of edema in patients with poor renal perfusion. The kidneys respond by retaining sodium and increasing plasma volume in an effo to increase renal blood flow. Sodium retention in cirrhosis is secondary to the decrease in plasma oncotic pressure and consequent decrease in plasma volume. Ref: Geller D.A., Goss J.A., Tsung A. (2010). Chapter 31. Liver.

Serotonin production is characteristic of gut carcinoid tumors. Serotonin is metabolized to 5-HIAA. Therefore, finding high levels of 5-HIAA in a 24-hour urine collection in a patient with flushing or other symptoms is highly suggestive of the diagnosis. Serotonin has numerous biologic effects, including stimulating intestinal secretion with inhibition of absorption, stimulating increases in intestinal motility, and stimulating fibrogenesis. In various studies 56-88% of all carcinoid tumors were associated with serotonin overproduction; however, 12-26% of the patients did not have the carcinoid syndrome. In one study platelet serotonin was elevated in 96% of patients with midgut carcinoids, 43% with foregut tumors, and 0% with hindgut tumors. In 90-100% of patients with the carcinoid syndrome there is evidence of serotonin overproduction. Serotonin is thought to be predominantly responsible for the diarrhea because of its effects on gut motility and intestinal secretion, primarily through 5-HT3 and, to a lesser degree, 5-HT4 receptors.

The same reactions are the underlying basis for several diseases. Contact dermatitis is an example of tissue injury resulting from T cell-mediated inflammation. It is evoked by contact with pentadecylcatechol (also known as urushiol, the active component of poison ivy and poison oak, which probably becomes antigenic by binding to a host protein). On reexposure of a previously exposed person to the plants, sensitized TH1 CD4+ cells accumulate in the dermis and migrate toward the antigen within the epidermis. Here they release cytokines that damage kera- tinocytes, causing separation of these cells and formation of an intraepidermal vesicle, and inflammation manifested as a vesicular dermatitis. It has long been thought that several systemic diseases, such as type 1 diabetes and mul- tiple sclerosis, are caused by TH1 and TH17 reactions against self antigens, and Crohn disease may be caused by uncon- trolled reactions involving the same T cells but directed against intestinal bacteria. T cell-mediated inflammation also plays a role in the rejection of transplants, described later in the chapter. Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity DTH is a T cell-mediated reaction that develops in response to antigen challenge in a previously sensitized individual. In contrast with immediate hypersensitivity, the DTH reac- tion is delayed for 12 to 48 hours, which is the time it takes for effector T cells to be recruited to the site of antigen chal- lenge and to be activated to secrete cytokines. The classic example of DTH is the tuberculin reaction, elicited by chal- lenge with a protein extract of M. tuberculosis (tuberculin) in a person who has previously been exposed to the tuber- cle bacillus. Between 8 and 12 hours after intracutaneous injection of tuberculin, a local area of erythema and indura- tion appears, reaching a peak (typically 1 to 2 cm in diam- eter) in 24 to 72 hours and thereafter slowly subsiding. On histologic examination, the DTH reaction is characterized by perivascular accumulation (\"cuffing\") of CD4+ helper T cells and macrophages (Fig. 4-13). Local secretion of cyto- kines by these cells leads to increased microvascular per- meability, giving rise to dermal edema and fibrin deposition; the latter is the main cause of the tissue induration in these responses. DTH reactions are mediated primarily by TH1 cells; the contribution of TH17 cells is unclear. The tubercu- lin response is used to screen populations for people who have had previous exposure to tuberculosis and therefore have circulating memory T cells specific for mycobacterial proteins. Notably, immunosuppression or loss of CD4+ T cells (e.g., resulting from HIV infection) may lead to a nega- tive tuberculin response even in the presence of a severe infection. Prolonged DTH reactions against persistent microbes or other stimuli may result in a special morphologic pattern of reaction called granulomatous inflammation. The initial perivascular CD4+ T cell infiltrate is progressively replaced by macrophages over a period of 2 to 3 weeks. These accumulated macrophages typically exhibit morphologic evidence of activation; that is, they become large, flat, and eosinophilic, and are called epithelioid cells. The epitheli- oid cells occasionally fuse under the influence of cytokines (e.g., IFN-g) to form multinucleate giant cells. A micro- scopic aggregate of epithelioid cells, typically surrounded by a collar of lymphocytes, is called a granuloma (Fig. 4-14, A). The process is essentially a chronic form of TH1-mediated inflammation and macrophage activation (Fig. 4-14, B). Older granulomas develop an enclosing rim of fibroblasts and connective tissue. Recognition of a granuloma is of diagnostic impoance because of the limited number of conditions that can cause it (Chapter 2).\n\nAnswer: B"}]}

Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is a diverse group of disorders with many subtypes categorized by disease gene and inheritance. LGMD usually manifests in the proximal muscles around the hips and shoulders. (The proximal muscles are those closest to the center of the body; distal muscles are faher away from the center -- for example, in the hands and feet). The shoulder girdle is the bony structure that surrounds the shoulder area, and the pelvic girdle is the bony structure surrounding the hips. Collectively, these are called the limb girdles, and it is the observed weakness and atrophy (wasting) of the muscles connected to the limb girdles that has given this group of disorders its name. Weakness in the shoulder area may make reaching over the head, holding the arms outstretched, or carrying heavy objects difficult. It may become increasingly hard to keep the arms above the head for such activities as combing one's hair or arranging things on a high shelf. Some people find it harder to type on a computer or other keyboard and may even have trouble feeding themselves. Some of the LGMD subtypes also are characterized by additional symptoms. For example, the hea can be affected in some types of LGMD, with weakness of the hea muscle (cardiomyopathy) and/or abnormal transmission of signals that regulate the heabeat (conduction abnormalities or arrhythmias). Some disease subtypes also involve the muscles used for breathing, and for that reason, respiratory function, along with cardiac function, should be monitored regularly.

Many children resist going to bed, and parents frequently give in just to get the child to sleep by allowing the child to sleep in the parents' bed or allowing them to stay up late. Unfortunately, children learn remarkably well how to get what they want, and the parents' concessions only make the problem worse. Learned behavior (behavioral insomnia, dyssomnia) is the root of many sleep disturbances in young children.Other types of sleep disturbance in children fall into the category of sleep disruptions, such as nightmares and night terrors.A nightmare is a scary or disturbing dream that usually awakens the child and causes agitation about the content of the dream. Nightmares occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Many children and adults have an occasional nightmare; recurrent or frequent nightmares, however, may be indicative of an ongoing stress in the child's life. Night terrors (pavor nocturnus) are non-REM phenomena seen less commonly than nightmares, occurring in 1% to 6% of all children. The child will be described as apparently awake but unresponsive; they can have evidence of autonomic arousal such as tachycardia, sweating, and tachypnea, and appear frightened and agitated. Attempts at calming the child are usually not effective, and the child will eventually go back to sleep. Although usually a problem in early childhood, night terrors can sometimes continue through adolescence.Somnambulism, or sleepwalking, occurs in 15% of children and is described as recurrent episodes of rising from bed and walking around. The child is typically hard to arouse and will have amnesia after the event. This usually happens in the first third of the sleep cycle, during stage 4 non- REM sleep. Somniloquy, or sleep talking, can occur at any sleep stage and is seen in all ages.\n\nAnswer: C"}]}

At least this could help somewhat... Prepare you for the correct options or other options in the exams. The human genome is very large and contains many thousands of genes. Therefore, finding the paicular gene or genes responsible for any given human disease is very difficult. Traditionally, the search for a disease gene begins with linkage analysis. In this approach, the aim is to find out the rough location of the gene relative to another DNA sequence called a genetic marker, which has its position already known. The principle of linkage analysis: Two fundamental principles are essential for understanding the concept of linkage. 1) When two genes or alleles are close together on a chromosome, they are usually transmitted together. Thus they are said to be linked. For example, in fruit flies the genes affecting eye color and wing length are inherited together because they appear on the same chromosome. Alleles for genes on different chromosomes are usually not linked, due to independent assoment of chromosomes during meiosis. 2)Because there is some crossing over of DNA when the chromosomes segregate, even linked alleles on the same chromosome can be separated and go to different daughter cells. There is a greater probability of this happening if the alleles are far apa on the chromosome, as it is more likely that a cross-over will occur between them. The odds of crossing over, or recombinant event, between two linked genes is propoional to the distance that separates them. Thus, genes that are far apa are more likely to undergo a recombination event than genes that are very close together. Thus by working out the number of recombinants it is possible to obtain a measure for the distance between the genes. This distance is called a genetic map unit (m.u.), or a centimorgan and is defined as the distance between genes for which one product of meiosis in 100 is recombinant. A linkage map is created by finding the map distances between numbers of traits that are present on the same chromosome, ideally avoiding having significant gaps between traits to avoid the inaccuracies that will occur due to the possibility of multiple recombination events. Linkage mapping is critical for identifying the location of genes that cause genetic diseases. A linkage map is a chromosome map of a species or experimental population that shows the position of its known genes and/or markers relative to each other in terms of recombination frequency, rather than as specific physical distance along each chromosome. Polymorphism is essential for linkage studies because they provide a means to distinguish the maternal and paternal chromosomes in an individual. All chromosomes are paired, one inherited from our mother and one from our father. Each pair of chromosomes contains the same genes in the same order, but the sequences are not identical. This means it should be easy to find out whether a paicular sequence comes from our mother or father. These sequence variants are called maternal and paternal alleles. Genetic markers are DNA sequences that show polymorphism (variations in size or sequence) in the population. They are present in everyone and they can be typed (the allele can be identified) using techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction . Disease genes are mapped by measuring recombination against the panel of different markers spread over the entire genome. In most cases, recombination will occur frequently, indicating that the disease gene and marker are far apa. Some markers however, due to their proximity, will tend not to recombine with the disease gene and these are said to be linked to it. Ideally, close markers are identified that flank the disease gene and define a candidate region of the genome between 1 and 5 million bp in length. The gene responsible for the disease lies somewhere in this region. Linkage is expressed as a lod (logarithm of odds score)- the ratio of the probability that the disease and marker loci linked rather than unlinked. By convention, a lod score greater than 3.0 is considered evidence for linkage. (A score of +3.0 means the likelihood of observing the given pedigree if the two loci are not linked is less than 1 in 1000). On the other hand, a lod score less than -2.0 is considered evidence to exclude linkage. Markers that are closest to the disease gene are less likely to undergo recombination events and therefore receive a higher linkage score. Linkage analysis is possible only for familial diseases, wherein pedigree analysis of the disease is done in that family. All the family is screened for the presence of all known polymorphisms. Then the polymorphism that is present in all the affected cases is identified as the linked allele and based on the location of this polymorphism, the possible location of the disease gene can be identified.\n\nAnswer: C"}]}

The higher the solute concentration of a solution, the greater its osmotic pressure. The plasma colloid osmotic pressure is often low in alcoholics with chronic liver disease (cirrhosis). The diseased liver cannot produce adequate amounts of albumin, which leads to a decrease in the concentration of albumin in the plasma (i.e., hypoalbuminemia).\n- Because approximately 75% of the plasma colloid osmotic pressure can be attributed to the presence of albumin in the plasma, the decrease in plasma albumin concentration that occurs in the latter stages of cirrhosis often leads to peripheral edema. Cirrhosis also causes excess fluid to accumulate in the peritoneal cavity as ascites.\n- In the case of ascites, the edema results not only from hypoalbuminemia, but also from portal vein obstruction (which increases capillary hydrostatic pressure) and the obstruction of lymphatic drainage of the liver.

DNA is also present in mitochondria (but less than 0.1% of the total DNA)\" - Harpers 30th/eMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA or or mDNA)oMitochondrial DNA is the only non-chromosomal DNA in human cells. Mitochondrial DNA is only a small portion of the DNA in a eukaryotic cell (less than 0.1% of the total DNA).oIn humans, the 16,569 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA encode for only 37 genes. Human mitochondrial DNA was the first significant part of the human genome to be sequenced.oMitochondrial DNA is almost always maternally inherited. Thus diseases caused by mutation in mitochondrial DNA are always inherited from mother to next generation. All children from affected mother will inherit the disease. But no children will inherit the disease from affected father. Both male and females are affected. Affected son does not transmit the disease to next generation.oMitochondrial vs. Nuclear DNAoSimilar to the nuclear genome, the mitochondrial genome is built of double-stranded DNA, and it encodes genes. However many interesting features distinguish human mitochondrial DNA from its nuclear counterpart, including the following:oThe mitochondrial genome is circular, whereas the nuclear genome is linear.oThe mitochondrial genome is built of 16,569 DNA base pairs, whereas the nuclear genome is made of 3.3 billion DNA base pairs.oThe mitochondrial genome contains 37 genes that encode 13 proteins, 22 tRNAs, and 2 rRNAs.oThe 13 mitochondrial gene-encoded proteins all instruct cells to produce protein subunits of the enzyme complexes of the oxidative phosphorylation system, which enables mitochondria to act as the powerhouses of our cells.oThe small mitochondrial genome is not able to independently produce all of the proteins needed for functionality; thus, mitochondria rely heavily on imported nuclear gene products.oOne mitochondrion contains dozens of copies of its mitochondrial genome. In addition, each cell contains numerous mitochondria. Therefore, a given cell can contain several thousand copies of its mitochondrial genome, but only one copy of its nuclear genome.oThe mitochondrial genome is not enveloped, and is it not packaged into chromatin.oThe mitochondrial genome contains few, if any, noncoding DNA sequences. (Three percent of the mitochondrial genome is noncoding DNA, whereas 93% of the nuclear genome is noncoding DNA).oSome mitochondrial coding sequences (triplet codons) do not follow the universal codon usage rules when they are translated into proteins.oSome mitochondrial nucleotide bases exhibit functional overlap between two genes; in other words, the same nucleotide can sometimes function as both the last base of one gene and the first base of the next gene.oThe mitochondrial mode of inheritance is strictly maternal, whereas nuclear genomes are inherited equally from both parents. Therefore, mitochondria-associated disease mutations are also always inherited maternally.oMitochondrial genes on both DNA strands are transcribed in a polycistronic manner: Large mitochondrial mRNAs contain the instructions to build many different proteins, which are encoded one after the next along the mRNA. In contrast, nuclear genes are usually transcribed one at a time from their own mRNA.\n\nAnswer: A"}]}

HAPE and High Altitude Cerebral Edema are most ominous forms of High altitude illness. Milder forms are - acute mountain sickness, retinal hemorrhages, and peripheral edema.The initial insult that causes HAPE is excessive hypoxia caused by the lower air pressure at high altitudes. The mechanisms by which this shortage of oxygen causes HAPE are poorly understood, but two processes are believed to be important:Increased pulmonary arterial and capillary pressures (pulmonary hypertension) secondary to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstrictionAn idiopathic non-inflammatory increase in the permeability of the vascular endothelium.* Treatment includesDescent from altitude,BedrestOxygen \" Inhaled nitric oxideNifedipine.\n\nAnswer: B"}]}

Ref: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RanulaA ranula is a type of mucocele found on the floor of the mouth. Ranulas present as a swelling of connective tissue consisting of collected mucin from a ruptured salivary gland duct, which is usually caused by local trauma.The Latin rana means frog, and a ranula is so named because its appearance is sometimes compared to a frog's underbelly.An oral ranula is a fluctuant swelling with a bluish translucent color. If it is deeper it does not have this bluish appearance. If it is large (2 or more), it may hide the salivary gland and affect the location of the tongue.Most frequently it stems from the sublingual salivary gland, but also from the submandibular gland.Though normally above the mylohyoid muscle, if a ranula is found deeper in the floor of the mouth, it can appear to have a normal color. A ranula below the mylohyoid muscle is referred to as a \"plunging or cervical ranula\", and produces swelling of the neck with or without swelling in the floor of the mouth.Ranulas measure several centimeters in diameter and are usually larger than mucoceles. As a result, when ranulas are present the tongue may be elevated.As with mucoceles, ranulas may be subject to recurrent swelling with occasional rupturing of its contents.When pressed, they may not blanch.Ranulas may be asymptomatic, although they can fluctuate rapidly in size, shrinking and swelling, making most ranulas hard to detect. How-ever, if it gets large enough it may interfere with swallowing. The overly-ing mucosa is usually intact. The swelling is not fixed and is non-painful unless it becomes secondarily infected.Microscopically, ranulas are cystic saliva filled distensions of sali-vary gland ducts on the floor of the mouth alongside the tongue, and lack a true epithelium.Treatment of ranulas could involve either marsupialization or more often excision of both the gland and lesion. Ranulas are likely to recur if the sublingual gland or other gland causing them is not also removed with the lesion. There is little morbidity or mortality connected with treatment.\n\nAnswer: A"}]}

Niacin can be synthesised in the body in limited amounts from the amino acid tryptophan. Deficiency - pellagra Pellagra was formerly endemic among poor people who subsisted chiefly on maize, which contains niacytin, a form of niacin that the body is unable to utilise. Pellagra can develop in only 8 weeks in individuals eating diets that are very deficient in niacin and tryptophan. It remains a problem in pas of Africa, and is occasionally seen in alcoholics and in patients with chronic small intestinal disease in developed countries. Pellagra can occur in Hanup's disease, a genetic disorder characterised by impaired absorption of several amino acids, including tryptophan. It is also seen occasionally in carcinoid syndrome (p. 678), when tryptophan is consumed in the excessive production of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin). Pellagra has been called the disease of the three Ds: * Dermatitis. Characteristically, there is erythema resembling severe sunburn, appearing symmetrically over the pas of the body exposed to sunlight, paicularly the limbs and especially on the neck but not the face (Casal's necklace, Fig. 19.13). The skin lesions may progress to vesiculation, cracking, exudation and secondary infection. * Diarrhoea. This is often associated with anorexia, nausea, glossitis and dysphagia, reflecting the presence of a non-infective inflammation that extends throughout the gastrointestinal tract. * Dementia. In severe deficiency, delirium occurs acutely and dementia develops in chronic cases. Treatment is with nicotinamide, given in a dose of 100 mg 3 times daily orally or parenterally. The response is usually rapid. Within 24 hours the erythema diminishes, the diarrhoea ceases and a striking improvement occurs in the patient's mental state.

(Cushing's reflex)Ordinarily, the blood pressure comes to a new equilibrium level slightly higher than the cerebrospinal fluid pressure, thus allowing blood to continue flowing to the brain.The cushing reaction helps to protect the vital centres of the brain from loss of nutrition if ever the CSF pressure rises high enough to compress the cerebral arteries.The rise in the arterial pressure causes a reflex decrease in heart rate via the arterial baroreceptors and this is why bradycardia rather than tachycardia is characteristically seen in patients with increased intracranial pressure.\n\nAnswer: C"}]}

Multi infarct (or vascular) dementia (or atherosclerotic psychosis), the 2,0 most common cause of dementia (not Alzheimer's disease) is caused by cerebro- vascular disease (ischemia or infarct)Q. It is characterized by an abrupt onset, acute exacerbations ((lit repeated infarcts), stepwise wise (step-ladder pattern) progressionQ (i.e. impairment of memory & intellect), fluctuating course (periods of deterioration f/b paial recovery for few months) and presence of hypeension (m.c.), cardiovascular disease & h/o previous stroke or transient ischemic attack. Lewy Body dementia, the 2,,d most common cause of degenerative dementia characteristically presents with progressive & fluctuating dementia (affecting cognition, attention & visuosptial ability), recurrent delirium like phase, systematized delusions, visual hallucinations (usually well formed & detailed), motor features of Parkinsonism (bradykinesia > tremor, rigidity), extra pyramidal symptoms, neuroleptic sensitivity syndrome (to antipsychotics)Q, together with repeated fallsQ, syncope, transient loss of consciousness, autonomic dysfunctions (eg. ohostatic hypotension) & urinary incontinence.

Pick's disease (in contrast to parietal - temporal- Alzheimers ds,)Q is a prototype fronto- temporal dementia. It classically presents with insidious onset gradually progressive behavioural & personality changes (frontal lobe function) and language disorder (such as aphasia - left temporal lobe function) usually preceding or overshadowing patient's cognitive problems. Patients may show apathy (medial frontal damage), disinhibition (basal - frontal dysfunction), symptoms of kluver Bucy syndrome (i.e. hypersexuality, hyperorality, placidity, and a compulsion to attend to any visual stimulus) and loss of drive, motivation, insight and spontaneity of speech (frontal language). The striking pathological findings is Knife blade atrophy of frontal & temporal poles with Pick's cells (ballooned neurons) and Pick's inclusion body (irregular, silver staining, intracytoplasmic bodies composed of tau, ubiquitin etc that displace nucleus towards periphery).

Erythropoietin can also be extracted from the spleen and salivary glands, but these tissues do not contain the mRNA and consequently do not appear to manufacture the hormone.When renal mass is reduced in adults by renal disease or nephrectomy, the liver cannot compensate and anemia develops. Erythropoietin is produced by interstitial cells in the peritubular capillary bed of the kidneys and by perivenous hepatocytes in the liver. It is also produced in the brain, where it exes a protective effect against excitotoxic damage triggered by hypoxia; and in the uterus and oviducts, where it is induced by estrogen and appears to mediate estrogen-dependent angiogenesis.\n\nAnswer: A"}]}
